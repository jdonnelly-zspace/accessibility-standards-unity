## Usage Examples (Post-Phase 5)

### For Non-Developers

**Install and run audit:**
```bash
# Follow EXTERNAL-CAPTURE-GUIDE.md

# Step 1: Install Node.js from nodejs.org

# Step 2: Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/jdonnelly-zspace/accessibility-standards-unity.git
cd accessibility-standards-unity
npm install

# Step 3: Run audit
node bin/audit.js "C:\Path\To\UnityProject" \
  --capture-screenshots \
  --application "C:\Path\To\YourApp.exe" \
  --analyze-visual
```

### For Developers

**Install Unity components AND auditing tool:**
```bash
# Install auditing tool (see above)

# Install Unity components
cp -r implementation/unity/scripts/* YourProject/Assets/Scripts/Accessibility/
cp -r implementation/unity/prefabs/* YourProject/Assets/Prefabs/Accessibility/
```

### For CI/CD

**Integrate into pipeline:**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/accessibility.yml
- name: Run Accessibility Audit
  run: |
    node bin/audit.js . \
      --capture-screenshots \
      --application "Builds/MyApp.exe" \
      --fail-on-regression
```

## Known Issues and Limitations

### Phase 3 OCR Limitation (Documented)
- **Issue:** OCR-based scene detection may misidentify scenes
- **Impact:** Low scene coverage (7.7% in Career Explorer test)
- **Workaround:** Use Unity batch mode OR manual screenshots
- **Status:** Documented in EXTERNAL-CAPTURE-GUIDE.md troubleshooting

### Tesseract.js Warning (Non-Critical)
- **Issue:** "logger is not a function" warning during OCR init
- **Impact:** None - OCR functionality works correctly
- **Status:** Known issue, does not affect results

### Windows-Only (Platform Limitation)
- **Issue:** External capture uses Windows-specific APIs
- **Impact:** Mac/Linux not supported
- **Status:** Documented in EXTERNAL-CAPTURE-GUIDE.md FAQ

---

## Next Steps (Post-Phase 5)

### Optional Enhancements
1. **Video Demo** (Optional Phase 5 task)
   - Record screen capture of full workflow
   - Upload to YouTube or GitHub
   - Link from README.md

2. **GitHub Release**
   - Tag v3.4.0-phase4 release
   - Attach binaries (if applicable)
   - Update release notes

3. **Blog Post / Announcement**
   - Write blog post about external capture
   - Share on zSpace developer community
   - Social media announcement

### Future Improvements (Not Phase 5)
1. Improve OCR scene detection (Phase 3 enhancement)
2. Add Mac/Linux support (platform expansion)
3. GUI for non-technical users (future feature)
4. Real-time progress visualization (enhancement)
