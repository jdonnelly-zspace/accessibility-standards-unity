## Safe Language Patterns

### Status Indicators

Use consistent icons:
- ‚úÖ **Available Now** - Feature exists in current release
- üîÑ **Under Development** - Actively being worked on
- üìã **Planned** - On roadmap but not started

**Always qualify ‚úÖ statements:**
- "Keyboard navigation available (varies by scene)"
- "Partial screen reader support (under enhancement)"
- "Available in Unity 2023.2+ implementations"

### Commitment Language

‚úÖ **SAFE:**
- "We are working to..."
- "Our goal is to..."
- "Development priority"
- "Under active development"
- "Exploring options for..."

‚ùå **AVOID:**
- "Will implement by..."
- "Guaranteed to..."
- "100% compliant"
- "Available in Q1 2026"

### Qualifier Phrases

Always include context:
- "Varies by Unity version"
- "Depends on scene implementation"
- "Contact us for configuration guidance"
- "Subject to technical feasibility"
- "Based on automated analysis"

### Accommodation Commitments

‚úÖ **SAFE:**
