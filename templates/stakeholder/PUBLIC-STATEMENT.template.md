### Platform-Specific Considerations

**zSpace Desktop Stereoscopic 3D:**

{{APP_NAME}} runs on the zSpace platform, which has unique accessibility considerations:

**What is zSpace?**
- Desktop stereoscopic 3D display (24" screen)
- Tracked glasses (3D viewing)
- Stylus input (3D interaction)
- Windows 10/11 desktop operating system
- Seated, desk-based experience

**Accessibility Implications:**
- **Stereoscopic Depth:** 10-15% of users cannot perceive 3D depth (stereoblindness, monocular vision) - we provide alternative depth cues
- **Stylus Input:** Not all users can use stylus - we provide keyboard/mouse alternatives
- **Desktop Screen Readers:** Windows desktop screen readers (NVDA, Narrator, JAWS) can integrate with proper Unity implementation
- **Visual Contrast:** Testing on actual zSpace hardware recommended for accurate validation

---

### Industry Leadership

**Open-Source Accessibility Framework:**

{{APP_NAME}} is developed using the accessibility-standards-unity framework, an open-source toolkit for zSpace accessibility:

- **Framework:** https://github.com/jdonnelly-zspace/accessibility-standards-unity
- **Purpose:** Advance accessibility across the zSpace application ecosystem
- **License:** MIT (free and open)
- **Includes:** Unity C# components, testing tools, documentation, VPAT templates

We believe transparency and open collaboration advance accessibility for all zSpace users.

- âœ… **W3C XAUR** (XR Accessibility User Requirements - zSpace adapted)
- ðŸ”„ **WCAG 2.2 Level AA** (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines for desktop)
