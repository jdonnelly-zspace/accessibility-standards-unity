### What are the key accessibility challenges for zSpace?

**zSpace-Specific Considerations:**

1. **Stereoscopic Depth** - 10-15% of users cannot perceive 3D depth (stereoblindness, monocular vision)
   - Requires alternative depth cues (size, shadows, audio, haptics)

2. **Stylus Input** - Primary interaction method may not be accessible to all users
   - Requires keyboard, mouse, or voice alternatives

3. **Desktop Screen Readers** - zSpace runs on Windows desktops
   - Unity 2023.2+ Accessibility API provides screen reader integration
   - Requires developer implementation

4. **Visual Contrast** - zSpace display characteristics
   - Requires testing on actual zSpace hardware for accurate contrast validation
