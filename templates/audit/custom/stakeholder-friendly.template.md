## What is Accessibility?

Accessibility ensures that everyone, including people with disabilities, can use your application effectively. This includes:
- People who cannot use a mouse or stylus
- People who use screen readers due to visual impairments
- People with color blindness or low vision
- People with hearing impairments
- People with cognitive or motor disabilities

Making your application accessible isn't just good practice—it's often legally required and expands your potential user base significantly.

## Understanding the Issues

### Common Accessibility Issues Explained

#### Keyboard Navigation
**What it means:** Some users cannot use a mouse or stylus. They need to navigate using only their keyboard.

**Your status:** {{#if KEYBOARD_SUPPORT}}Supported✓{{else}}Not Supported✗{{/if}}

**Why it matters:** Without keyboard support, users with motor disabilities, blind users, and power users cannot efficiently use your application.

#### Screen Reader Support
**What it means:** Screen readers are software that reads interface elements aloud for blind and low-vision users.

**Your status:** {{#if SCREEN_READER_SUPPORT}}Supported✓{{else}}Not Supported✗{{/if}}

**Why it matters:** Without screen reader support, blind users cannot know what buttons or text are on screen.

#### Visual Contrast
**What it means:** Text and UI elements need sufficient color contrast to be readable.

**Your status:** {{CONTRAST_COMPLIANCE_RATE}}% compliant

**Why it matters:** Low contrast makes content difficult or impossible to read for users with low vision or color blindness.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do we really need to do this?
In many jurisdictions, yes. Beyond legal requirements, accessibility improves the experience for all users and expands your potential market.

### Will this delay our project?
Critical fixes can be implemented in {{CRITICAL_TIMELINE}}. The remaining improvements can be phased in over time.

### Can we automate accessibility testing?
Partially. We've automated detection of many issues, but about 30% of accessibility requirements need manual testing.

### How do we maintain accessibility going forward?
We recommend:
1. Integrate accessibility checks into your development process
2. Train your team on accessibility best practices
3. Run periodic audits (quarterly recommended)
4. Include accessibility in code reviews

### What if we don't have time/budget now?
At minimum, address the critical issues ({{CRITICAL_ISSUES}} items). This prevents excluding entire user groups and reduces legal risk.
