# zSpace Accessibility Framework Adaptation Plan

## Project Overview
Adapt accessibility-standards-unity from VR/AR headsets (Meta Quest, Vive, PSVR)
to zSpace stereoscopic 3D desktop platform.

**Repository:** https://github.com/jdonnelly-zspace/accessibility-standards-unity
**Target Platform:** zSpace (stereoscopic 3D display + tracked glasses + stylus)
**Standards:** WCAG 2.2 Level AA + W3C XAUR (adapted for zSpace)
**Version Goal:** 2.0.0 (major platform change)

---

## Key Platform Differences

### zSpace Platform:
- 24" stereoscopic 3D desktop display
- Tracked glasses (not HMD/headset)
- Stylus with 3 buttons, LED, vibration
- Seated desktop experience
- Keyboard/mouse available
- Primary use: K-12 education, medical training, CAD/design
- Less motion sickness risk (no locomotion)
- Multi-user viewing possible (screen visible to others)

### VR Headsets (Original Framework):
- Head-mounted displays (Meta Quest, Vive, PSVR)
- Hand controllers or hand tracking
- Immersive locomotion (teleport, smooth movement)
- High motion sickness risk
- Single-user experience
