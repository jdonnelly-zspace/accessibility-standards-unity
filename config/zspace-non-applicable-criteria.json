      "title": "Parsing",
      "level": "A",
      "status": "not-applicable",
      "reason": "Unity applications are not markup-based",
      "justification": "Unity applications do not use HTML, XML, or any markup language that can be parsed by assistive technologies. Unity uses a component-based architecture with C# scripts and proprietary scene files, not parseable markup. Content is rendered directly via DirectX/OpenGL, not through markup parsing.",

      "level": "AA",
      "status": "not-applicable-conditional",
      "reason": "No personal data collection",
      "justification": "This criterion specifically addresses autocomplete functionality for personal data fields in web forms. The application does not collect personal user information, has no form fields for user data, focuses on educational content, and has no account creation functionality.",
      "applicableWhen": "Application implements user profiles, account creation, or personal data collection forms"

      "title": "Audio-only and Video-only (Prerecorded)",
      "level": "A",
      "status": "not-applicable-conditional",
      "reason": "No audio-only or video-only content",
      "justification": "Automated code analysis detected no audio-only or video-only media content. Application uses real-time 3D rendering, not pre-recorded media.",
      "applicableWhen": "Application includes tutorial videos, audio narration tracks, pre-recorded demonstrations, or video testimonials"

      "level": "A",

      "reason": "No video content",
      "justification": "No video files, video streams, or video-only presentations detected. Application uses interactive 3D content.",
      "applicableWhen": "Application includes video content requiring audio descriptions",
      "note": "WCAG 1.2.2 (Captions) may still apply for synchronized multimedia"

    "1.3.4": {
      "title": "Orientation",
      "level": "AA",
      "status": "supports-special-case",
      "reason": "Fixed hardware orientation",
      "justification": "zSpace displays are physically landscape-oriented monitors that cannot be rotated. The stereoscopic 3D effect depends on specific display orientation for head-tracking. Content is not programmatically restricted; the hardware's physical orientation is an inherent device characteristic.",
      "essentialException": "Stereoscopic 3D rendering with head-tracking requires specific orientation for proper depth perception",
      "conformanceStatement": "Application supports this criterion by default as content is not programmatically restricted to a single orientation"

    "1.4.10": {
      "title": "Reflow",
      "level": "AA",
      "status": "limited-applicability",
      "reason": "Fixed-resolution native application",
      "justification": "This criterion was designed for responsive web content on variable viewport sizes, not fixed-resolution native applications. zSpace displays have fixed native resolutions (1920x1080 typical), apps run full-screen on dedicated hardware, and Unity uses absolute positioning and canvas scaling, not CSS reflow.",
      "modernInterpretation": "Equivalent accessibility achieved through scalable UI elements, adjustable text sizes, responsive canvas sizing, and support for different zSpace display resolutions",
      "exception": "3D spatial environments require two-dimensional layout for usage or meaning"

      "title": "Text Spacing",
      "level": "AA",
      "status": "limited-applicability",
      "reason": "CSS properties do not exist in Unity",
      "justification": "This criterion specifically references CSS properties (line-height, margin-bottom, letter-spacing, word-spacing) that do not exist in Unity's text rendering system. Unity uses TextMesh Pro with different property models.",

      "level": "AA",
      "status": "not-applicable-conditional",
      "reason": "English-only content (typical)",
      "justification": "If application is English-only with no mixed-language content, this criterion does not apply. Unity does not have native language markup like HTML's lang attribute.",

      "reason": "Web terminology does not map to Unity architecture",
      "justification": "This criterion uses web-centric terminology ('Web pages') that doesn't directly map to Unity. Unity applications use scenes and states, not pages. Navigation may be spatial (3D environments) rather than hierarchical (menu-based).",

      "justification": "This applies to Unity applications but must be interpreted for game engine architecture. Unity uses reusable prefabs and components. Interactive buttons and 3D objects with the same function should have consistent visual appearance and accessible names.",
