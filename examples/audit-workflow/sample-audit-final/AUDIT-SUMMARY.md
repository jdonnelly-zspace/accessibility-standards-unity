## Remaining Low Priority Items

### 1. **Add Voice Command Shortcuts for Power Users**
**Priority:** LOW (Enhancement)
**Impact:** Quality-of-life improvement for advanced users

**Description:**
Voice commands implemented but limited to basic navigation. Could add advanced shortcuts like "rotate left/right", "zoom in/out", "show element details" for power users.

**Recommendation:**
Extend VoiceCommandManager.cs with additional commands. Not required for compliance but would improve user experience.

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 hours

## User Feedback

### Testing with Users with Disabilities (Week 7)

**Participant 1: Motor disability (keyboard-only user)**
> "I can now navigate the entire periodic table and explore molecules using just my keyboard. The Space key for selection and arrow keys for navigation feel natural. This is a huge improvement!"

**Participant 2: Blind user (NVDA screen reader)**
> "The screen reader support works perfectly. Every button is clearly labeled, and I can understand the molecule structure through the audio descriptions. I can actually learn chemistry now!"

**Participant 3: Stereoblind user (monocular vision)**
> "I was worried I couldn't use this because I can't see 3D, but the size scaling and shadows make it completely usable. I can tell which atoms are in front and which are behind. The spatial audio really helps too."

## Recommendations for Maintenance

### Ongoing Compliance

1. **Re-audit before each release**
   ```bash
   a11y-audit-zspace . --verbose
   ```

2. **Run automated tests in CI/CD**
   - Unity Test Framework accessibility tests
   - Contrast checker on UI changes
   - Keyboard navigation validation

3. **Manual testing checklist**
   - Keyboard-only walkthrough
   - Screen reader navigation (NVDA)
   - 2D mode verification

4. **Update VPAT annually**
   - Keep VPAT current for customer requests
   - Update if WCAG standards change
   - Re-test after major Unity version upgrades

### Future Enhancements (Optional)

- Add more voice command shortcuts (Low Priority issue above)
- Explore eye-tracking support if zSpace adds hardware support
- Consider multi-language accessibility (screen reader in Spanish, etc.)
- Add user-customizable accessibility settings menu
