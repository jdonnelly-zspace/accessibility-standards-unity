## Testing Limitations

This automated audit has the following limitations:

1. **Scope:** Only tested application launch and stability; did not test interactive features
2. **Duration:** 30-second monitoring window may not capture all runtime issues
3. **Input:** No user interaction simulated; requires manual testing for keyboard/mouse accessibility
4. **Visual:** No visual analysis performed; color contrast and UI element visibility not assessed
5. **Hardware:** Testing performed without zSpace hardware; some features may require specialized equipment

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

1. **Run Quick Win 4: Keyboard Navigation Test**
   - Requires manual execution with application in focus
   - Tests Tab, Enter, Space, Arrow key navigation
   - Generates WCAG 2.1.1 compliance report

2. **Conduct Manual WCAG 2.1 AA Audit**
   - Use accessibility checklist for manual verification
   - Test with assistive technologies (screen readers)
   - Document findings and create remediation plan

3. **Review and Address Findings**
   - Prioritize issues by severity and WCAG level
   - Create tickets for remediation work
   - Assign owners and timelines

### Long-term Actions

4. **Establish Accessibility Testing Process**
   - Integrate automated tests into CI/CD pipeline
   - Schedule regular manual accessibility reviews
   - Train development team on accessibility best practices
   - Create accessibility guidelines for future development

5. **Monitor and Maintain**
   - Set up automated monitoring for accessibility regressions

## Conclusion

Career Explorer demonstrates excellent application stability and performance characteristics based on automated testing. The application launches reliably, manages resources efficiently, and executes without errors.

**Overall Assessment: READY FOR MANUAL ACCESSIBILITY TESTING**

While automated tests show no critical issues, comprehensive manual accessibility testing is required to verify WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance. The next phase should include:

1. Manual keyboard navigation testing (WCAG 2.1.1)
2. Visual accessibility audit (contrast, text size)
3. Screen reader compatibility testing
4. User testing with people with disabilities

The foundation is solid, and with proper manual verification and any necessary remediation, Career Explorer can achieve full WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance.
