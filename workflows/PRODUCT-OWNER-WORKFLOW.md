# Product Owner Workflow - Accessibility Planning (zSpace Unity)

This guide shows Product Owners how to ensure accessibility is built into **zSpace Unity applications** from planning through acceptance.

**Target Platform:** zSpace (stereoscopic 3D desktop + Unity)
**Standards:** WCAG 2.2 Level AA + W3C XAUR (adapted for zSpace)

---

## Why Accessibility Matters for zSpace Applications

**Market Impact (zSpace-Specific):**
- **Education Market:** 15% of K-12 students have disabilities - zSpace apps must be inclusive
- **Medical Training:** Healthcare professionals with disabilities need accessible training tools
- **Legal Risk:** Section 508 (government), ADA Title III (private education), WCAG 2.2 compliance
- **User Base:** 10-15% of users **cannot perceive stereoscopic 3D** - depth alternatives are CRITICAL
- **Brand Reputation:** First accessible zSpace platform sets industry standard

**zSpace-Specific Accessibility Challenges:**
- **Stereoscopic 3D Dependency:** 10-15% of users have stereoblindness/amblyopia/strabismus
- **Stylus-Only Interaction:** Users with motor impairments need keyboard alternatives
- **Desktop Screen Readers:** NVDA/Narrator/JAWS integration required for blind users
- **Depth Perception:** Size, shadow, audio, haptic cues needed for non-stereoscopic users

**Business Impact:**
- **Market Access:** 15% of global population has disabilities (~1.3 billion people)
- **Legal Risk:** Accessibility lawsuits increasing (US ADA Title III, EU Accessibility Act, Section 508)
- **Better UX:** Accessibility improvements help all users (keyboard shortcuts benefit everyone)
- **Brand Reputation:** Demonstrates commitment to inclusion

**Cost of Waiting:**
- Fixing later costs **10-100x** more than building accessible from start
- Retrofitting requires redesign + re-development + re-testing
- May delay releases while addressing compliance issues

## FAQs

**Q: How much does accessibility slow down development?**
A: ~10-15% initially, decreasing to ~5% once team is trained. Building accessible from start is actually faster than retrofitting.

**Q: Can we do accessibility in a later phase?**
A: Not recommended. Retrofitting costs 10-100x more and risks legal issues.

**Q: Do we need to hire accessibility experts?**
A: No. Free tools (ESLint, Lighthouse, axe) + this framework are sufficient for WCAG Level AA compliance.

**Q: What if we find an accessibility issue after release?**
A: Prioritize as P0/P1 bug, fix in next sprint, update VPAT if applicable.

**Q: How do I know if we're compliant?**
A: Lighthouse â‰¥ 95, axe 0 violations, QA manual testing passed, WCAG 2.2 specific tests passed, VPAT completed.

**Q: What's new in WCAG 2.2?**
A: 9 new success criteria, including focus visibility (SC 2.4.11), target size 24x24px (SC 2.5.8), dragging alternatives (SC 2.5.7), form autocomplete (SC 3.3.7), and accessible authentication (SC 3.3.8). All covered in this framework.

**Q: Do we need to update existing features for WCAG 2.2?**
A: Yes, eventually. Prioritize high-traffic features and authentication flows. Most new features will be compliant if built using this framework.
