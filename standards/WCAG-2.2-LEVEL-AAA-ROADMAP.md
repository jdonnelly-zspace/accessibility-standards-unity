# WCAG 2.2 Level AAA Compliance Roadmap

**Current Status:** WCAG 2.2 Level AA - COMPLETE ‚úÖ
**Target:** WCAG 2.2 Level AAA (Highest Conformance)
**Date:** October 2025

---

## Executive Summary

Your repository currently achieves **WCAG 2.2 Level AA** compliance with 57 documented success criteria. To reach **Level AAA** (the highest and most stringent level), you need to add **28 additional Level AAA-specific success criteria**.

**Important Context:**
- **Level AAA is NOT required for most organizations** - Level AA is the internationally recognized standard
- **Level AAA is often aspirational** - Some criteria are impossible to satisfy for all content
- **W3C does not recommend Level AAA as a blanket requirement** for entire sites
- **Level AAA is typically targeted** for specific high-impact content or specialized applications

---

## Gap Analysis

### Current Coverage: 57 Criteria (Level AA Complete)
‚úÖ All Level A criteria (30 criteria)
‚úÖ All Level AA criteria (27 criteria)
‚ùå Level AAA criteria (0 of 28 criteria)

### Level AAA Requires: 28 Additional Criteria
- **Perceivable:** 8 criteria
- **Operable:** 13 criteria
- **Understandable:** 7 criteria
- **Robust:** 0 criteria (no AAA criteria in this principle)

---

## Complete List of Level AAA Success Criteria

### Principle 1: Perceivable (8 AAA Criteria)

#### 1.2.6 Sign Language (Prerecorded) - Level AAA üÜï
**Requirement:** Provide sign language interpretation for all prerecorded audio content in synchronized media.

**What it means:**
- Videos with audio must include a sign language interpreter
- Sign language track appears alongside video content
- Benefits deaf users who prefer sign language over captions

**Implementation effort:** HIGH (requires professional sign language interpreters)

**Typical applications:**

- Legal content

---

#### 1.2.7 Extended Audio Description (Prerecorded) - Level AAA üÜï
**Requirement:** When pauses in foreground audio are insufficient for audio descriptions to convey the sense of the video, provide extended audio description.

**What it means:**
- Video pauses to allow longer audio descriptions
- Used when standard audio description can't fit between dialogue

**Implementation effort:** HIGH (requires video editing and professional narration)

---

#### 1.2.8 Media Alternative (Prerecorded) - Level AAA üÜï
**Requirement:** Provide an alternative for time-based media (like a full text transcript with all visual and audio information).

**What it means:**
- Full text alternative describing all visual and auditory content
- Goes beyond captions - includes all visual information
- Like a screenplay or detailed transcript

**Implementation effort:** MEDIUM (can be done in-house with training)

---

#### 1.2.9 Audio-only (Live) - Level AAA üÜï
**Requirement:** Provide live captions for live audio-only content.

**What it means:**

**What it means:**
- Much higher contrast requirements than Level AA
- More stringent than AA's 4.5:1 requirement
- Benefits users with low vision or color deficiencies

**Implementation effort:** MEDIUM (design system changes, testing)

**Example:**
```css
/* Level AA: 4.5:1 minimum */
.text-aa {

## Recommendations

### Should You Target Level AAA?

**YES, target Level AAA if:**
- ‚úÖ Government/public sector site (may be required by law)
- ‚úÖ Healthcare/medical content
- ‚úÖ Educational platform
- ‚úÖ High accessibility commitment organization
- ‚úÖ Content for vulnerable populations
- ‚úÖ Budget and timeline support it ($100k+ for meaningful sites)

**NO, stick with Level AA if:**
- ‚ùå E-commerce site (AA is industry standard)
- ‚ùå Corporate website (AA meets most legal requirements)
- ‚ùå Limited budget (<$50k for accessibility)
- ‚ùå Tight deadlines (<6 months)
- ‚ùå Content type makes AAA impractical (e.g., freehand drawing tools)

**Hybrid approach (RECOMMENDED):**
- Maintain Level AA as baseline
- Target Level AAA for specific high-impact areas:
  - User-facing content (reading level, contrast)
  - Forms and authentication (error prevention, no cognitive tests)
  - Navigation (focus appearance, link clarity)
  - Documentation (abbreviations, unusual words)
- Document which areas achieve AAA and which achieve AA

## Questions to Answer Before Starting

1. **Budget:** What's the total budget for Level AAA? ($50k-$1M+)
2. **Timeline:** How long can this project take? (6-24 months)
3. **Scope:** Full AAA or targeted areas?
4. **Resources:** Can we hire specialists? (sign language, content writers, audio engineers)
5. **Content:** Can we rewrite content to 8th grade level? (3.1.5)
6. **Media:** Budget for sign language interpreters? ($1k-$5k per video)
7. **Features:** Can we remove timed elements? (2.2.3)
8. **Tools:** Budget for live captioning services? ($150-$300/hour)
9. **Exemptions:** Which criteria are impractical for our content?
10. **Compliance:** Is full AAA legally required or aspirational?

---

## Summary

**To achieve WCAG 2.2 Level AAA, you need to:**

‚úÖ Keep your existing 57 Level AA criteria (DONE)
‚ûï Add 28 Level AAA-specific criteria (TO DO)
üí∞ Budget $50k-$1M+ depending on site size
‚è±Ô∏è Plan 6-24 months timeline
üéØ Consider targeted/hybrid approach (AAA for key areas, AA elsewhere)
üìÑ Create extensive documentation and testing
üë• Potentially hire specialists (sign language, audio, content)

**Level AAA is the gold standard** but is not required or even recommended by W3C for entire sites. A targeted approach focusing on high-impact areas is often the most practical path forward.
