# Accessibility Documentation Communication Guide

**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** January 2025
**Purpose:** Guide for creating market-positioned accessibility documentation that balances transparency with legal protection
**Audience:** Development teams, product managers, legal counsel, marketing teams

---

## Executive Summary

This guide provides templates and guidelines for creating accessibility documentation that:

- ‚úÖ Positions your product as an accessibility leader
- ‚úÖ Meets procurement and legal requirements

## Core Philosophy

### The Balance

**Transparency Without Liability:**
- Share what you're working on without promising when it will be done
- Document current capabilities accurately
- Indicate development direction without binding commitments
- Demonstrate good faith effort while protecting flexibility

**Market Leadership Without Overcommitment:**
- Position ahead of competitors on transparency
- Lead with process and framework, not just features
- Emphasize ongoing commitment over point-in-time compliance
- Build trust through honesty about limitations

## Language Framework

### Safe Language Patterns

#### ‚úÖ SAFE: Current Status

**Available Now:**
- "Feature X is available in current release"
- "Feature Y is included in version [specific version]"
- "This capability is present in [specific modules/contexts]"

**Important Note:** Availability may vary by version, module, or configuration.

#### ‚úÖ SAFE: Development Direction

**Under Development:**
- "Expanding keyboard support"
- "Enhancing screen reader compatibility"
- "Working toward [goal]"

**Planned Enhancements:**
- "Exploring options for [feature]"
- "Evaluating feasibility of [capability]"
- "Considering [improvement]"

**Note:** Enhancement priorities and timelines are subject to change based on technical feasibility, resource availability, and user feedback.

#### ‚úÖ SAFE: Commitment Language

- "We are working to..."
- "Our goal is to..."
- "We aim to..."
- "Development priority"
- "Under active development"
- "Planned enhancement"
- "Exploring options for..."
- "Evaluating feasibility of..."

### Unsafe Language Patterns

#### ‚ùå AVOID: Specific Dates

**BAD:**
- "Available in Q1 2026"
- "Will be released by March 2026"
- "Compliance achieved by June 2026"
- "48-hour response guarantee"

**USE INSTEAD:**
- "Near-term priority"
- "Upcoming release"
- "Actively working toward compliance"
- "Prompt response to accommodation requests"

#### ‚ùå AVOID: Definitive Commitments

**BAD:**
- "Will implement..."
- "Guaranteed to..."
- "All users will be able to..."
- "100% compliant"
- "Full support for..."

**USE INSTEAD:**
- "Under development"
- "Working toward..."
- "Expanding support for..."
- "Pursuing conformance"
- "Enhancing compatibility with..."

#### ‚ùå AVOID: Unqualified Feature Lists

**BAD:**
- "‚úÖ Keyboard accessible"
- "‚úÖ Screen reader compatible"
- "‚úÖ WCAG 2.2 Level AA compliant"

**USE INSTEAD:**
- "üîÑ Expanding keyboard support"
- "üîÑ Enhancing screen reader compatibility"
- "Working toward WCAG 2.2 Level AA conformance"

**OR (if actually available):**
- "‚úÖ Keyboard navigation available (varies by module)"
- "‚úÖ Partial screen reader support (under enhancement)"
- "Substantial conformance with WCAG 2.2 Level AA (detailed VPAT available)"

---

## Status Indicator System

Use consistent icons throughout documentation:

| Icon | Meaning | Use When |
|------|---------|----------|
| ‚úÖ | Available Now | Feature exists in current release |
| üîÑ | Under Development | Actively being worked on |
| üìã | Planned | On roadmap but not yet started |
| ‚ö†Ô∏è | Partial Support | Works in some contexts, not others |
| ‚ùå | Not Supported | Currently not available (use sparingly in external docs) |

**Important:** Always qualify ‚úÖ statements with context like "varies by module" or "in select features"

---

## Standard Disclaimer Template

### Required Disclaimer (All Documents)

Place at end of every accessibility document:

```markdown
---

## Important Disclaimer

**Accuracy and Currency:** Information in this document reflects [Product Name]'s accessibility status and plans as of [Publication Date]. Accessibility features, enhancement priorities, timelines, and capabilities are subject to change without notice.

**Individual Needs:** Accommodation feasibility depends on specific user requirements, software version, module design, and current technical capabilities. We recommend contacting [accessibility contact] for individualized consultation regarding specific accommodation requests.

**Third-Party Content:** [If applicable] Some [Product Name] content is developed by third parties. Accessibility features and accommodation options may vary by content source.

## VPAT-Specific Guidance

### Replace "Conformance Level" Language

Throughout VPAT, avoid binary "Supports/Does Not Support" when possible:

| Traditional VPAT | Framework Alternative |
|------------------|----------------------|
| "Does Not Support" | "Enhancement Planned" or "Under Development" |
| "Supports" | "Available (see remarks)" - always include context |
| "Partially Supports" | "Partial Support - Enhancement Underway" |
| "Not Applicable" | "Not Applicable" (this one stays the same) |

### In Remarks Column:

- **Current capability:** "Feature X is available in current release (varies by [module/context])"
- **Under development:** "Enhancement underway to expand [capability]"
- **Planned:** "Planned enhancement for [general area]"

---

## Competitive Comparison Framework

### When to Use Competitive Comparisons

Use competitive comparisons when:
- ‚úÖ You have verifiable public information
- ‚úÖ Comparison helps justify vendor selection
- ‚úÖ Positioning for sales/marketing purposes
- ‚úÖ Responding to direct competitive questions

### Avoid Competitive Comparisons When:

- ‚ùå Information is speculative or outdated
- ‚ùå Could be seen as disparaging
- ‚ùå Your own status is weak in that area
- ‚ùå Legal has not reviewed claims

### Safe Comparison Language

**Example:**
```markdown
### [Product] Accessibility Competitive Position

**Documentation Transparency:**
[Product Name] provides comprehensive accessibility documentation including:
- ‚úÖ Public VPAT
- ‚úÖ Accessibility statement on website
- ‚úÖ Quick reference for procurement
- ‚úÖ Open-source auditing framework

**Industry Context:** Based on publicly available information, most competing [product category] platforms have not published comparable accessibility documentation.

**Last Verified:** [Date]

**Note:** Competitive information is based on publicly available documentation as of [date] and may not reflect current capabilities.
