# External Communication Guide for Accessibility Documentation

> **Purpose**: Guide for communicating zSpace accessibility status to external stakeholders while balancing transparency with legal protection.
> **Audience**: Development teams, product managers, legal counsel, marketing teams
> **Version**: 1.0 (October 2025)

---

## Executive Summary

When sharing accessibility documentation about zSpace Unity applications, follow these principles:

‚úÖ **Be transparent** about current status and development direction
‚úÖ **Avoid binding commitments** to specific features or dates
‚úÖ **Qualify all statements** with appropriate context and disclaimers
‚úÖ **Position proactively** as an accessibility leader through transparency
‚úÖ **Protect flexibility** while demonstrating good faith effort

---

## Core Philosophy: The Balance

### Transparency Without Liability

**DO:**
- Share what you're working on without promising when it will be done
- Document current capabilities accurately
- Indicate development direction without binding commitments
- Demonstrate good faith effort while protecting flexibility

**DON'T:**
- Promise specific dates ("Available in Q1 2026")
- Guarantee specific features ("Will implement...")
- Make absolute claims ("100% compliant")
- Overstate current capabilities

---

## Safe Language Patterns for zSpace

### ‚úÖ SAFE: Current Status

**Good Examples:**
```markdown
**Available Now:**
- Keyboard alternatives for stylus interactions in Scene Manipulation module
- Adjustable text contrast in UI components (version 2.1.0+)
- Spatial audio cues for 3D navigation

**Important Note:** Availability may vary by Unity version, scene
complexity, and zSpace SDK version. Contact accessibility@[company].com
for specific configuration guidance.
```

**Why it works:** Specific but qualified, includes version context, provides contact for questions

### ‚úÖ SAFE: Development Direction

**Good Examples:**
```markdown
**Under Development:**
- Expanding screen reader compatibility for Unity 2023.2+ projects
- Enhancing depth perception alternatives for non-stereoscopic users
- Working toward comprehensive WCAG 2.2 Level AA conformance

**Note:** Enhancement priorities and timelines are subject to change
based on technical feasibility, resource availability, and user feedback.
```

**Why it works:** Shows direction without dates, includes standard disclaimer, uses "working toward" not "will achieve"

### ‚úÖ SAFE: Commitment Language

**Good Examples:**
```markdown
- "We are working to expand keyboard support"
- "Our goal is to achieve WCAG 2.2 Level AA conformance"
- "Screen reader compatibility is a development priority"
- "Exploring options for voice command integration"
- "Evaluating feasibility of haptic feedback enhancements"
```

**Why it works:** Directional, not definitive; shows effort without guarantees

---

## ‚ùå UNSAFE Language Patterns

### Avoid: Specific Dates

‚ùå **BAD:**
- "Available in Q1 2026"
- "Compliance achieved by June 2026"
- "48-hour response guarantee"

‚úÖ **INSTEAD USE:**
- "Near-term priority"
- "Actively working toward conformance"
- "Prompt response to accommodation requests"

### Avoid: Definitive Commitments

‚ùå **BAD:**
- "Will implement voice commands"
- "Guaranteed to work with all screen readers"
- "All zSpace applications will be accessible"
- "100% WCAG 2.2 compliant"

‚úÖ **INSTEAD USE:**
- "Voice commands under development"
- "Expanding screen reader compatibility"
- "Working toward accessibility across zSpace applications"
- "Pursuing WCAG 2.2 Level AA conformance"

### Avoid: Unqualified Feature Claims

‚ùå **BAD:**
- "‚úÖ Keyboard accessible"
- "‚úÖ Screen reader compatible"
- "‚úÖ WCAG 2.2 Level AA compliant"

‚úÖ **INSTEAD USE:**
- "üîÑ Expanding keyboard support (available in select scenes)"
- "üîÑ Enhancing screen reader compatibility (Unity 2023.2+)"
- "Working toward WCAG 2.2 Level AA conformance (detailed VPAT available)"

## Status Indicator System

Use consistent icons throughout all zSpace accessibility documentation:

| Icon | Meaning | Use When | Example |
|------|---------|----------|---------|
| ‚úÖ | Available Now | Feature exists in current release | ‚úÖ Keyboard navigation (Unity 2023.2+, varies by scene) |
| üîÑ | Under Development | Actively being worked on | üîÑ Screen reader integration for spatial UI |
| üìã | Planned | On roadmap but not started | üìã Voice command system for zSpace |
| ‚ö†Ô∏è | Partial Support | Works in some contexts, not others | ‚ö†Ô∏è Depth cues (available in specific modules) |

**CRITICAL:** Always qualify ‚úÖ statements with context like "varies by module," "Unity version X+," or "in select features"

---

## Standard Disclaimer (Required)

**Place at the end of EVERY external accessibility document:**

```markdown
---

## zSpace-Specific Considerations

### Technical Complexity Requires Extra Qualifiers

zSpace accessibility involves multiple dependencies:
- Unity Engine version (2021.3 vs 2023.2+ differences)
- zSpace SDK version
- Desktop OS (Windows screen reader compatibility)
- Scene design (developer implementation choices)
- Hardware setup (3D glasses, stylus, display)

**Therefore, ALWAYS include qualifiers:**
- "Varies by Unity version"
- "Depends on scene implementation"
- "Requires Unity 2023.2+ for screen reader support"
- "Contact us for configuration-specific guidance"

### Unique Accessibility Challenges

When discussing zSpace-specific features, be honest about complexity:

‚úÖ **Good:**
```markdown
**Depth Perception Alternatives:**
Stereoscopic 3D is core to zSpace, but not all users can perceive
depth. We provide alternative depth cues including:
- üîÑ Spatial audio positioning (under enhancement)
- ‚úÖ Visual depth indicators (available, varies by scene)
- üìã Haptic feedback via stylus (planned)

These alternatives allow users to interact with 3D content without
relying on stereoscopic vision. Effectiveness varies by application
design and user needs.
```

‚ùå **Bad:**
```markdown
‚úÖ Works without 3D glasses
‚úÖ Full depth perception alternatives
```

### Desktop Accessibility Context

Remember: zSpace runs on Windows desktops, not mobile/VR:

‚úÖ **Good:**
```markdown
**Screen Reader Support:**
zSpace applications run on Windows desktops and can integrate with
desktop screen readers (NVDA, Narrator, JAWS). Unity 2023.2+ provides
the Accessibility Module for screen reader integration. Implementation
depends on developer usage of accessibility APIs.
```

‚ùå **Bad:**
```markdown
‚úÖ Screen reader compatible (implying it works universally)
```

---

## Competitive Positioning for zSpace

### Transparency as a Differentiator

Most zSpace application developers don't publish accessibility documentation. Position proactively:

‚úÖ **Safe competitive language:**
```markdown
**Industry Leadership:**
This accessibility framework provides comprehensive documentation that
exceeds typical zSpace application accessibility transparency. Most
zSpace applications do not publish VPATs or accessibility documentation.

We believe transparency benefits the disability community, educators,
and procurement teams evaluating accessibility requirements.
```

### Questions to Ask Other Vendors

Provide these questions for procurement teams evaluating competing zSpace applications:

```markdown
## Questions for zSpace Application Vendors

When evaluating accessibility of zSpace applications, ask vendors:

1. "Can you provide a current VPAT for your zSpace application?"
2. "How does your application work for users who cannot perceive stereoscopic 3D?"
3. "What keyboard alternatives exist for stylus interactions?"
4. "Does your application support Windows screen readers (NVDA, Narrator, JAWS)?"
5. "Have you tested with Unity 2023.2+ Accessibility Module?"
6. "What is your accommodation process for users with disabilities?"
7. "Do you provide documentation for accessible scene design?"

**Note:** Many zSpace application vendors have not conducted accessibility
evaluation or published documentation.
```
