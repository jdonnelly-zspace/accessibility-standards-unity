# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

After pushing these changes, configure the following on GitHub:

## Repository Settings

```

### 4. Features

### 5. Visibility
Consider making the repository **Public** since this is a standards framework meant to be shared. If keeping private, ensure collaborators have access.

## Issue Labels

The default labels should work, but you can add these custom labels:

| `good first issue` | `#7057ff` | Good for newcomers |
| `help wanted` | `#008672` | Extra attention needed |

## Branch Protection (Optional)

If collaborating with others, protect the `main` branch:
1. Go to Settings → Branches
2. Add rule for `main`
3. Enable:
   - ✅ Require pull request reviews before merging
   - ✅ Require status checks to pass (if you add CI)
   - ✅ Include administrators

## Social Preview

Upload a social preview image (1280x640px) showcasing:
